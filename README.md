## Explain

This plugin is for [FawryPay](https://developer.fawrystaging.com/docs-home). It's implemented the native SDKs to work on Flutter environment.

> It works for Android fine. iOS works fine on **Real Device** only (FawryPay Requirements).

## Getting Started

Add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_fawry_pay: ^0.0.3
```


### Android

You have to edit `AndroidManifest.xml` file with following.

```manifest
<manifest ...
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools" 
    ... />
    ...
    <application
        ...
        tools:replace="android:theme,android:label,android:name" 
        ... >
    ...
    </appliaction>
</manifest>
```

And download this [file](https://github.com/ShadyBoshra2012/flutter_fawry_pay/blob/master/example/android/app/libs/fawryplugin-release.aar), and put it in `app/libs` folder (If not exist, create it).


### iOS

No actions needed, just work on Real Device only. Need xCode 12.x and SWIFT 5.3.x. 


## Usage

You just have to import the package with

```dart
import 'package:flutter_fawry_pay/flutter_fawry_pay.dart';
```

Then, you need to initialize the SDK.

```dart
FlutterFawryPay.instance.init(
  style: Style.STYLE1,
  skipCustomerInput: true, // If set to true, you must set username and email.
  username: "01234567890", // Must be phone number.
  email: "abc@test.com",
);
```

Now, you can stream the result data that from SDK.

```dart
FlutterFawryPay.instance.callbackResultStream().listen((event) {
  FawryResponse response = FawryResponse.fromMap(data);
  print(response);
});
```

Let's now make our first payment initialize, you must set your merchantID that token from FawryPay system, and set your FawryItems that the user will pay for.

> Note that: there's error in native FawryPay SDK for android to retrieve again customParam.

```dart
FlutterFawryPay.instance.initialize(
  merchantID: Keys.merchantID,
  items: [
    FawryItem(sku: "1", description: "Item 1", qty: 1, price: 20.0),
  ],
);
```

You can set some parameters like: `merchantRefNumber, language, environment, customParam`.

And when you are ready for production you have to set the environment to Live.

```dart
FlutterFawryPay.instance.initialize(
  environment: Environment.LIVE,
  merchantID: Keys.merchantID,
  items: [
    FawryItem(sku: "1", description: "Item 1", qty: 1, price: 20.0),
  ],
);
```

So, it was initialized well, how to start payment? You have TWO ways.

### First way: Native Fawry Button

You can use the native button for FawryPay SDK. through this only widget.

```dart
FawryButton()
```

### Second way: Your custom widget

You can use your own widget with a function to call with `FlutterFawryPay.instance.startProcess()`.

```dart
RaisedButton(
  onPressed: () async {
  FawryResponse response = await FlutterFawryPay.instance.startProcess();
  },
  child: Text("Start Payment"),
)
```

There's a function in FawryPay is CardTokenizer, you can use it like this way:

> Note that: there's error in native FawryPay SDK for android to retrieve again customParam.

```dart
FlutterFawryPay.instance.initializeCardTokenizer(
  merchantID: Keys.merchantID,
  customerMobile: "01234567890",
  customerEmail: "abc@test.com",
  customParam: {
    "order_id": "123213",
    "price": 231.0,
  },
);
```

Last function you can use is reset the initialization (Android only), doing that:

```dart
FlutterFawryPay.instance.reset();
```

## Objects

```dart
class FawryItem {
  String sku;
  String description;
  int qty;
  double price;
  double? originalPrice;
  int? height;
  int? length;
  double? weight;
  int? width;
  String? variantCode;
  List<String>? reservationCodes;
  String? earningRuleID;
}

class FawryResponse {
  /// Parameters for payment process.
  String transactionID;
  DateTime expiryDate;
  
  /// Parameters for card tokenizer process.
  String cardToken;
  DateTime creationDate;
  String lastFourDigits;
  
  /// Common parameters for all process.
  Map<String, dynamic> customParam;
  String errorMessage;
}
```


## Enums

```dart
/// Enums for Environment configuration.
///
/// [TEST] for test stage atfawry.fawrystaging endpoint.
/// [LIVE] for production stage atfawry endpoint.
enum Environment { TEST, LIVE }
